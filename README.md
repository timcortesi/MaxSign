# Max's NeoPixel Sign

## Overview

This project uses a NodeMCU microcontroller to render a "slideshow" of static images using several rows of individually addressable RGB LEDs. At startup, the NodeMCU module connects to Wifi and downloads the images in JSON format from github pages. There is also a separate web application which can be used to create / draw new images, and configure the slideshow settings.
